                    Lions have strong, compact bodies and powerful forelegs, teeth and jaws for pulling down and killing
                    prey.
                    Their coats are yellow-gold, and adult males have shaggy manes that range in color from blond to
                    reddish-brown to black.
                    The length and color of a lion's mane is likely determined by age, genetics and hormones.

                    Zebras are single-hoofed animals that are native to Africa. ...
                    Each species of zebra has a different general pattern of stripes.
                    The Grevy's zebra has very thin stripes. The mountain zebra has vertical stripes on its neck and
                    torso, but horizontal stripes on its haunches.

                    Leopards are big cats known for their golden, spotted bodies and graceful, yet ferocious hunting
                    techniques.
                    They are often thought of as an African animal, but leopards live all over the world.
                    Though their reach is vast, their numbers are declining.

            <p>Today, zoos are meant to entertain and educate the public but have a strong emphasis on scientific
                research and species conservation.
                There is a trend toward giving animals more space and recreating natural habitats.
                Zoos are usually regulated and inspected by the government
